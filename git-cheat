# 🧩 Step 1: Fetch the latest changes from remote (no merge, no pull)
git fetch origin

# 🧩 Step 2: Compare your local branch with remote branch (shows code differences)
git diff main origin/main

# 🧩 Step 3: See which commits are new on the remote (not in your local branch)
git log main..origin/main

# 🧩 Step 4: See which commits you have locally but are not pushed yet
git log origin/main..main

# 🧩 Step 5: List only the names of files that changed
git diff --name-only main origin/main

# 🧩 Step 6: Show a summary (files changed + lines added/removed)
git diff --stat main origin/main

# 🧩 Step 7: Quick combined view — what commits + what changed
git fetch origin && git log main..origin/main --oneline && git diff --stat main origin/main

#configuring git
git config --global user.name "<name>"

git config --list

git status
-> untracked files. #git is unaware about these files(newly created and never added and commited)
-> modified (changes n files)
-> staged (added and ready to commit)
-> unmodified (unchanged file)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

git rev-parse --show-toplevel           ###tells about root of repo
rm -rf .git   ###to remove git from a dir

git init
git remote add origin <link to repo>
git branch -M main
git pull origin main (if created readme.md)
git push -u origin main

## new branch
git checkout -b branch1           #create new branch
git branch                        # to check in which branch we are in
git checkout <branch name>                # to change the working branch
git branch -d <branch name>       # should run from differnt branch to delete the branch


#Merging code of 2 branches
#way1 

git diff <branch name>
git merge <branche name>

##way2
create a PR


##undoing of changes
1. staged changes(added)
git reset <filename>
git reset ##for multiple files
git restore --staged <filename>
git rm --cached file.txt      ==> add it to .gitignore

2. commited changes (for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1
 git log ## to check commits

 3. commited changes (for multiple commits)
 git reset <hash of commit from git file>
 git reset --hard <commit hash>

git log --oneline graph

git checkout main
git merge feature1

git cgeckout feature1
git rebase main. ##rewrites history

both can cause conflicts but merge=> safety and on shared branches  and rebase=> cleanup
